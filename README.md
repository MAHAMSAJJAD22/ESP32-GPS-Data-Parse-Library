# ESP32-GPS-Data-Parse-Library
This project is a library for the ESP32 microcontroller, developed using vscode stable framework, that allows for parsing GPS data in the NMEA format (NMEA 0183). The library provides functions to extract individual parameters from GPS packets, specifically focusing on the GGA (Global Positioning System Fix Data) packet.
